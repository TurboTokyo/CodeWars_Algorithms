# CodeWars Algorithms

This repository hosts solutions for algorithm problems from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), an online platform that enhances coding skills through challenging problems.

The algorithms are implemented in C/C++, and each algorithm resides in its dedicated directory.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of these solutions, clone the repository using the following command:

``` git clone https://github.com/TeuerStein/CodeWars_Algorithms.git ```

## Structure

Each directory in the repository represents a different problem from CodeWars. Inside each directory, you'll find a `main.c` file which contains the C code solution for the respective problem.

For example, the directory `Make_a_spiral` contains the solution for the "Make a Spiral" problem.

## Running the Solutions

To run any solution:

1. Navigate into the problem directory, for example:
    ```
    cd CodeWars_Algorithms/Make_a_spiral/
    ```

2. Compile the C program using a compiler such as `gcc`:
    ```
    gcc main.c -o main
    ```

3. Run the compiled program:
    ```
    ./main
    ```
